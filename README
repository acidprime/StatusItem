I have updated my sample slide project. This is a basic example of a (menu item).

I built this with Xcode 3 as I'm not using 4 as my IDE yet.

This shows you how to integrate shell and AppleScript code into a custom objC App.

Basically there are 6 scripts in this xcode project.

menuOne ~ menuThree are shell scripts that populate (grey) menu items

Check out the settings.plist:scriptPlugins:nonPrivilegedScripts to see how the are loaded.

Hopefully you will find the keys such as "isAlternate" self explanatory

In the event of a non-zero exit, the scripts pull text from the plist 

(as something went wrong) and we don't want to show it to our users.

The header doubles as a Apple Script launcher menu item (be careful with multi-threading).

Known Issue:
Currently we don't handle AppleScript runtime issues, even simple ones like hitting cancel, so
check the console log for errors if your debugging AppleScript.
